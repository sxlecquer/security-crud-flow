# Security CRUD Flow

The project implements a university system in which the user has a certain role:
- Lecturer - 'ADMIN'
- Curator - 'MODERATOR'
- Student - 'USER'

Depending on the role, the user has access to different mappings. For example, admin can delete user or moderator accounts.

## Features

## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sxlecquer/security-crud-flow.git
```

Open the cloned project in the IDE and go to `resources/application.yml` in client module.  
1. Configure connection to your database:
```yaml
datasource:
  url: // link to the database
  username: // your username
  password: // your password
  driver-class-name: // database driver name
```

2. Provide OAuth2.0 client-id and client-secret from your GitHub and Google accounts in security section:
```yaml
security:
  oauth2:
    client:
      registration:
        github:
          client-id: // your generated github client id
          client-secret: // and client secret
          scope:
            - user:email
            - read:user
        google:
          client-id: // your generated google client id
          client-secret: // and client secret
          scope:
            - openid
            - email
            - profile
```
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How to do this for [Google](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849?hl=en#:~:text=Go%20to%20the%20Google%20Cloud%20Platform%20Console%20Credentials%20page.,to%20add%20a%20new%20secret.)
and [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/authentication/authenticating-to-the-rest-api?apiVersion=2022-11-28#using-basic-authentication).
> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you skip this step, login using OAuth2.0 will not work.
3. Provide your email credentials from which you want to send emails to users with password reset links or email verification codes:
```yaml
mail:
  host: smtp.gmail.com
  port: 587
  username: // your email
  password: // your password
  properties:
    mail:
      smtp:
        auth: true
        starttls:
          enable: true
```

4. Go to `service/impl/CuratorServiceImpl` and comment out code in `fillCuratorTable()` method.  
Add `curatorService.fillCuratorTable()` to one of methods that are allowed for any user, e.g. in `homePage()` method:
```java
@GetMapping("/")
public String homePage() {
    curatorService.fillCuratorTable(); // add this line
    return "redirect:/home";
}
```
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same you can do for `service/impl/LecturerServiceImpl` and its `fillLecturerTable()` method.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now you can run the program, go to the browser and type [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/).  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, new records appear in the `curator` and `lecturer` tables of the database.  

#### So now you can fully test this application. <br> Enjoy!!! ðŸ˜‹
